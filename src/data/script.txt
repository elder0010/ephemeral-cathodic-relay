I found a way to send you images anyway.#DELAY=32#
Images that those stupid machines can't parse.#DELAY=96#

Even if a 8296 PET has no graphic modes
and only displays characters with a mere 1 bit colour depth.#DELAY=96#
//page 22
#PAGE#
I found a way to take advantage of the cathodic falloff
of 8296's unusually slow display phosphors.#DELAY=96#
//page 29
#PAGE#
I analyzed every shade of green left by the disappearing characters
and made a conversion routine that converts#DELAY=96#

That's why you should turn of the lights, if possible.#DELAY=32#
ECR gives it's best in lowlight conditions.#DELAY=96#
//page 34
#PAGE#
Now...#DELAY=32#
Let's say that I want to represent 4 specific shades of green#DELAY=96#
//page 35
#PAGE#
I just have to linearize the CRT falloff by delaying the character
tracing by a specific amount of time to set the correct exposure.#DELAY=96#
//page 36
#PAGE#
I can then exploit the phosphor falloff
and use it as an analog image generator 
with endless shades of green, like this.#DELAY=96#

The only limit is that images are, as the name implies,#DELAY=34# ephemeral.#DELAY=96#

I thought that could be a problem with more complex images.#DELAY=64#
