Hey.#LOADNEXT#

#PAGE#
It's me.

I really#DELAY=32# #STRING=5#REALLY#LOADSFX##DELAY=32# hope you still got that one I left you, down there.

Well, if you're reading this it means you survived #SETMARGIN=13,04#the drone strike and that you still have that #DELAY=16#8#DELAY=16#2#DELAY=16#9#DELAY=16#6.

When I said it was built like a tank I was dead serious.

#PAGE#
#DELAY=32#Now, let's get to work.#DELAY=32##SETMARGIN=13,04#I have two news for you.
//page 07
#PAGE#
#DELAY=32#First one is bad.
//page 08
#PAGE#
#DELAY=32#Very bad.

#PAGE#
#DELAY=32#They are on us.

#PAGE#
They managed to read every data, every image to predict our intentions. 
//page 11
#PAGE#
They still don't have pictures of me,#DELAY=32# but they know that I exist. 
//page 12
#PAGE#
So we need a safe way to exchange images#SETMARGIN=13,04#until we manage to meet again in person.
//page 13
#PAGE#
Second one is a good one: 
//page 14
#PAGE#
#DELAY=128#I like to think out of the box.#DELAY=32##SETMARGIN=13,04#I found a way to do it. 
//page 15
#PAGE#
To send you images that those stupid machines#SETMARGIN=13,04#can't see nor recognize.
//page 16
#PAGE#
A little invention of mine.

TLDR:#DELAY=32# This bulky, gorgeous display of yours is a very powerful device.#SETMARGIN=13,04##DELAY=32#It hides an incredible feature.#DELAY=32##SETMARGIN=14,04#A feature that was overlooked for more than 50 years.#DELAY=32# 
//page 21
#PAGE#
Even if a 8296 PET has no graphic modes#SETMARGIN=13,04#and only displays characters with a mere 1 bit colour depth.
//page 22
#PAGE#
I found a way to take advantage of the cathodic falloff#SETMARGIN=13,04#of its CRT display.
//page 23
#PAGE#
The 8296 tube is painted with unusually slow phosphors.
//page 24
#PAGE#
Look how slow it is to make the cursor really disappear.
//page 25
#PAGE#
#SETMARGIN=012,40#.#DELAY=256#

#PAGE#
Can you count how many shades of green you see before it disappears?
//page 25
#PAGE#
#SETMARGIN=012,40#.#DELAY=50#.#DELAY=50#.#DELAY=50#.#DELAY=128# 
//page 26
#PAGE#
You can't!
//page 27
#PAGE#
They are endless, it's a true, non linear, analog fade out. 
//page 28
#PAGE#
That's where my idea came in.
//page 29
#PAGE#
I analyzed every aspect of that fade out...
//page 30
#PAGE#
...and made a conversion routine that converts
//page 31
#PAGE#
#SETMARGIN=012,38##STRING=7#T I M E#DELAY=64#

#PAGE#
#SETMARGIN=011,38#into#SETMARGIN=012,35##STRING=10#L I G H T.#DELAY=128#

#PAGE#
I called it the#DELAY=32# #STRING=8#CATHODIC#DELAY=32# #STRING=8#EXPOSURE#DELAY=32# #STRING=5#CHART#DELAY=32#, C.E.C.#DELAY=64##SETMARGIN=13,04#(yeah, I really love high tech acronyms) 
//page 34
#PAGE#
Let's say that I want to represent 4 specific shades of gray.
//page 35
#PAGE#
I just have to linearize the CRT falloff by delaying the character#SETMARGIN=13,04# tracing by a specific amount of time to set#SETMARGIN=14,04# the correct exposure.
//page 36
#PAGE#
#SETMARGIN=012,20#1#SETMARGIN=012,30#2#SETMARGIN=012,40#3#SETMARGIN=012,50##DELAY=32#4#DELAY=128#
//page 37
#PAGE#
Now I can exploit the phosphor falloff,#DELAY=32##SETMARGIN=13,04#use it as an analog grayscale image generator
//page 38
#PAGE#
Like this.

#PAGE#
It's just done by sweeping a single line#SETMARGIN=13,04#from the top to the bottom of the screen with a specific timing.
//page 43
#PAGE#
There are way more gray levels inside this box#SETMARGIN=13,04#from the 80's than we could achieve#SETMARGIN=14,04#back in 2024 with those shitty RTX cards

The only limit is that images are, as the name implies,#LOADNEXT##DELAY=32#ephemeral.
//page 48
#PAGE#
I thought that could be a problem with more complex images#DELAY=32##SETMARGIN=13,04#so I started to test this on some simple renders.

The falloff time is just enough to appreciate the images#SETMARGIN=13,04#and that peculiar 8296 scanline surely helps fooling the eye!

Now that I think about it#DELAY=32#.#DELAY=32#.#DELAY=32#.#DELAY=32##SETMARGIN=13,04#you can even export em with your analog camera#DELAY=32#.#DELAY=32#.#DELAY=32#.#DELAY=32##SETMARGIN=014,04#or using any other photographic process.
