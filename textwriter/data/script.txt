Hey
It's me, 
I really really hope you still got that one I left you, down there.
Well, if you're reading this it means you still have that 8296.
When I said it was built like a tank I was dead serious.
How ironic: history's first personal computer happens to be the last one working.
I have two news for you
First one is bad.#DELAY=20# Very bad.#DELAY=20#
They are on us. 
They managed to read every data, every image to predict our intentions 
They still don't have pictures of me, but they know that I exist. 
The last photo you got from me was the last one you'll ever have until we manage to meet again in person.
Second one: 
I like to think out of the box and I found a way to send you pictures of me anyway. 
Images that those machines can't see nor understand.
It's a little invention of mine.
I like to call them

t's ECR for short. ðŸ™‚
This bulky, gorgeous display of yours is a very powerful device and hides an incredible feature.
Even if a 8296 PET has no graphic modes and  only display characters with a 1 bit colour depth
I found a way to take advantage of the cathodic falloff of its CRT display
the 8296 tube is painted with unusually slow phosphors 
look how slow it is to make the cursor really disappear #DELAY=80#
Can you count how many shades of green you see before it disappears? #DELAY=80#
You can't!
They are endless, it's a true, non linear analog fade out 
That's where my idea came in.
I measured time and light of that fade out
and I made a conversion routine that converts time in a grayscale value
It's called the Cathodic Exposure Chart, CEC.
(Love high tech acronyms)

Let's say that I want to represent 4 specific shades of gray
I just have to delay the character tracing by a specific amount of time to set the correct exposure
0#DELAY=40#1#DELAY=40#2#DELAY=40#3#DELAY=40#
Now I can exploit the phosphor falloff to act as an analog grayscale image generator
look at this example, it will be much easier to understand:
#IMAGE=1,500#
See? 
It's just done by sweeping a single line from the top to the bottom of the screen.
there are way more gray levels than we could achieve back in 2024 with those shitty RTX cards
This one is a horizontal one, look at the 80 columns in all of their glory!
#IMAGE=2,500#
You can achieve any kind of shading, just by delaying the brighter areas of the image
#IMAGE=3,500#
The only limit is that images are, as the name implies, ephemeral.
I thought that could be a problem with more complex images so I started to test this on some simple renders
